Experiment C1: Constant environment, M. minutum as algae species, 373 days. Missing data (t=0, t=10.98, t=154.2, t=203.95, t=218.05, t=226.94, t=237, and t=282.95) were removed. The data were interpolated using cubic hermite interpolation to obtain data with equidistant time intervals of 1.044818 day, yielding a total of 358 data points per time series. Time unit: days. Abundance units: (number of individuals (or cells)/ml).
